GitHub Pages:
If you haven't already set up GitHub Pages for your repository, you can do so by going to the "Settings" tab of your repository, scrolling down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and selecting main as the source.

After a few moments, your website should be accessible at https://username.github.io/repository-name/ (replace username with your GitHub username and repository-name with your repository name).
